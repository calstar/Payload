The stand-alone Muons code is located in the "Muons" folder. It is for reference only.

The "IRIS" folder contains the code intended to be used for the combined IRIS/Muons PCB assembly.

A driver is required to use the Arduino Nano in the original Muons detector, but that is no longer part of this PCB assembly.
As such, I can only guess that naming the detector (with "Naming.ino" from the Muons code) is not required.
In fact, there is only one pin that the Teensy microcontroller is concerned with in relation to Muons (pin 14, labelled "Detector").
